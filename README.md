This repository contains all the resources used by the team 'Banco Central de Chile' in the UN Datathon 2024. The team consists of Diego Donoso, Camilo Núñez, and Francisco Torres.

## Abstract
The main goal of this study is to assess the accessibility of public service facilities in Medellín and analyze its impact on both tourists and residents. Accessibility covers essential services like education, health, security, food, culture, and the environment, aiming to identify disparities in service access and their connection to quality of life across different city areas.

Quality of Life (QoL) is a comprehensive measure of the physical, emotional, social, and economic well-being of residents in tourist areas. As QoL is subjective, it depends on each individual’s and community’s experiences and expectations. In a tourism context, good QoL translates into employment, economic growth, and accessible services, enhancing both resident well-being and tourist satisfaction.

Tourism, when managed sustainably, can improve residents' quality of life by boosting the local economy and access to services. However, risks such as rising living costs, congestion, noise, and environmental degradation can negatively impact the community. Responsible tourism policy is essential to balance economic benefits with community well-being preservation.
